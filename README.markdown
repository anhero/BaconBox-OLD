The BaconBox engine 
=================
*Version: Development snapshot*

What is the BaconBox Engine?
--------------------------
The BaconBox Engine is a 2D game engine designed to run on every major platform. BaconBox 
was greatly inspired by the well known Flixel and Unity engines. The goal was to 
mix the cool stuff the popular engines had and smooth out some of the rough 
edges. There is still more to come for this engine; it is still in its infancy.

More detailed informations are available on 
[the BaconBox Engine website](http://baconbox.net/).
